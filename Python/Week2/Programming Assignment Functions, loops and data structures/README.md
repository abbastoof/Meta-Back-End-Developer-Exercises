# Lab Instructions: Functions, loops and data structures

In this lab I will be presented with a menu ordering system which will allow users to
input three choices for a select menu. I am tasked with completing the menu system so
that it returns and calculates the final bill for the user.

## Exercise Instructions

1. Extend the script to have a new function called `calculate_subtotal`.
 It should accept one argument which is the order list and return the sum
 of the prices of the items in the order list.

2. Implement `calculate_tax()` which calculates the tax of the subtotal.
The tax percentage is 15% of overall bill.

3. Implement `summarize_order()` which returns a list of the names of the items
that the customer ordered and the total amount (including tax) that they have to pay.
 The orders should show the name and price.
